<h1>Missing-Skill-Learning Report</h1>
<h1>SUMMARY</h1>
<p ><i>The missing-skill-learning session helps me to learn new skills in deep. In these sessions, I have learned about Linux, Git, and JavaScript. These sessions of Linux give me a detailed idea of Linux History and the commands. Increase my understanding of Javascript. I think the main part of javascript is the function which was very well described by taking many examples. How the computer contents with each other over the network was explained remarkably in the session of the basic building block of web development. 
 
Before learning things from missing skills I had some knowledge of Linux and javascript. But learning from missing skills expand my skills. The most interesting and new part for me was learning Git Hub. but never used git hub it was amazing to see how the git hub helps the programmers to work with each other from different places on the same project simultaneously. By creating the repository, push-pull request, creating new branches to merging them. It was something new that I learned beautifully.

I hope to learn more things in the future from missing skills.
